<h3>1. Intorduction</h3>
> Multiscale Peak Alignment (MSPA) has been proposed to align shift peaks among chromatograms automatically, accurately and rapidly. It can preserve the shapes of peaks (peak height and area) and has excellent speed during alignment. Furthermore, MSPA method seems more robust and not sensitive to noise and baseline during alignment. We believe that this method may be of particular interest to the researchers in high-throughput analysis fields such as metabolomics, quality control of herbal medicines and etc, who are suffering from the problem of retention time shift of massive chromatograms.


<h3>2. Installation & usage</h3>

1. Install MATLAB 6.5 or higher in you computer;

2. download, unzip the MSPA toolbox from:  http://mspa.googlecode.com/files/MSPA_1.0.rar ;

3. Change the current folder of MATLAB to the folder where you unzip MSPA\_1.0.rar;

4. Open the test.m file in the folder, and run the matlab code to perform aligment with MSPA.
